# Sphere Earth Repo
## What am I
This is a repo detailing how dependant variables can be calculated from independant variables using the assumption that the earth is a perfect sphere.
## Why we should assume the earth is a sphere in our calculations
After some analysis I calcuated that some values when obtained using the sphere earth assumption were larger than values obtained using the assumption that the earth is a flat plane. We know that the sphere earth assumption is closer to reality than the flat earth assumption so if it gives significantly different values to the flat earth assumption it should be used.

The values for imaging angle and the distance between the satellite and a target when imaging at our maximum off nadir angle of $45^\circ$ were calculated using both assumptions and the difference between the values gained for each assumption exceeded a 10% difference threshold. More than double a 5% standard for statistically significant difference.
